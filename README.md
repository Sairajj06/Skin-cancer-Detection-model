Skin Cancer Detection Model
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to assist in the early detection of skin cancer. Using advanced image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model classifies skin lesion images into various categories, such as benign or malignant.

About the Project
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, but early detection can significantly improve survival rates. This project leverages machine learning to provide a robust tool for detecting potential cancerous lesions from images.
Key features:
Preprocessing pipeline for image enhancement.
CNN-based architecture for classification.
Support for custom datasets.

Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available datasets, such as the ISIC 2019 Challenge Dataset.

Dataset Preparation:
Download the dataset from Kaagle Archive.
Organize the images into training, validation, and test sets.
Update the paths in the code to point to the dataset location.

Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:

Input Layer: Image dimensions of 224x224.
Convolutional and Pooling Layers for feature extraction.
Fully Connected Layers for classification.
Dropout for regularization.
